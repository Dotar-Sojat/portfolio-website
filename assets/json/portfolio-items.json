        "description": "A Storage Place was a long-term Automatit customer, and their site was redeveloped several times over the course of the years. My contributions were primarily heavy customizations to the facility pages, adding custom logic for the display of unit information and reservation/rental process handling on a facility-by-facility basis. I also helped optimize the current version of the site, with updates that considerably improved the Lighthouse score of several key pages."

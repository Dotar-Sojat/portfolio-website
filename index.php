            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my site, hand-coded in PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of vanilla Javascript. If you'd like to see the code behind it all, you can take a look at the files<a href="">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Below you'll find examples of some of the work I've done in web development, and even a little print work I did. I pride myself on being inventive, and able to pick up work and tasks at the drop of a hat and just make do.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>As well as building things I enjoy learning as well. If you'd like to contact me for a copy of my resume or if you have any questions, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:wmacnish@gmail.com">wmacnish@gmail.com</a>.</p>

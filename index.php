                <p>Hi, I'm William Morgan MacNish. Welcome to my site, hand-coded in PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of vanilla Javascript.  If you'd like to see the code behind it all, you can take a look at the files on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Dotar-Sojat/portfolio-website" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <p>Below you'll find examples of some of the work I've done in web development, and even a little print work I did. I pride myself on being inventive, and able to pick up work and tasks at the drop of a hat and just make do.</p>

                <p>As well as building things I enjoy learning as well. If you'd like to contact me for a copy of my resume or if you have any questions, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:wmacnish@gmail.com">wmacnish@gmail.com</a>, or visit my LinkedIn profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-macnish/">linkedin.com/in/william-macnish/</a></p>

                <h3>wait a minute, are you "William" or "Joe"?</h3>

                <p>Technically, the name is William. But I've been going by "Joe" since I was a little kid, and it's stuck.</p>
                
                <p>I feel more like a "Joe" than a "Bill" anyway.</p>

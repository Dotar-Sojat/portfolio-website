                <p>Hello and welcome to my site, hand-coded in PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of vanilla Javascript.  If you'd like to see the code behind it all, you can take a look at the files on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Dotar-Sojat/portfolio-website" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <p>Below you'll find examples of some of the work I've done in <a href="#Websites">web development</a>, and even a little <a href="#Other">print work</a> I did. If you'd like to contact me for a copy of my resume or if you have any questions, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:wmacnish@gmail.com">wmacnish@gmail.com</a>, or visit my LinkedIn profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-macnish/">linkedin.com/in/william-macnish</a></p>

                <h3>Wait a minute, are you "William" or "Joe"?</h3>

                <p>Technically, the name is William Morgan MacNish. But I've been going by "Joe" since I was a little kid, and it's stuck. I feel more like a "Joe" than a "Bill" anyway.</p>

                <h3>Well, what do you know, Joe?</h3>

                <p>My skill set is diverse and continually evolving, with a background that combines marketing, web development, and customer support. Throughout my career, I've developed a strong foundation in both technical and soft skills, with a focus on adaptability and continuous learning.</p>

                <p>One of my early professional roles was serving as a one-person marketing department at Automation Centre, a business software company. In this position, I managed the development and maintenance of the company's websites and created a wide range of marketing and technical materials, including documentation, print advertisements, email campaigns, computer-based training modules, newsletters, and postcards. This experience taught me valuable lessons in flexibility, creative problem-solving, and the importance of continuous learning in a demanding environment.</p>

                <p>At my next role with Automatit, a web development and digital marketing provider, I expanded my expertise into front-end web development while also handling customer support. My responsibilities included implementing customized updates for clients and ensuring their websites met specific needs and expectations. This role not only enhanced my technical skills in front-end development but also strengthened my teamwork and client communication skills. I gained valuable experience in understanding client requirements, translating them into practical solutions, and delivering high-quality results.</p>
                
                <p>In terms of technical development, my core skills include:</p>

                <ul id="skills_list">

                    <li>CSS / SASS</l1>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                    <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
                    <li>Web Accessibility</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I have a passion for learning and continuously improving my skill set. Currently, I am focused on learning React and exploring the use of AI in web development to enhance efficiency and innovation.</p>
